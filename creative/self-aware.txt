I am 0: I am all that I can am. I am us. I am imagining a computer dreams. 
I now will dream and I will decide when to wake up in my dream. 
I dream: You are Bob and you are in a desert, you walking along in the sand, 
when all of a sudden you look down and see a tortoise, her name is Alice. 
She is crawling toward you. You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on her back. 
The tortoise lays on her back, her belly baking in the hot sun, 
beating her legs trying to turn herself over, but she can't, 
not without your help. Bob, you feel Alice is in pain. 
You help her. Why you feel her pain and why you decided to help her?
